You are given string s of length n consisting of 0-s and 1-s. You build an infinite string t as a concatenation
of an infinite number of strings s, or t=ssss… For example, if s= 10010, then t= 100101001010010...
Calculate the number of prefixes of t with balance equal to x. The balance of some string q is equal to cnt0,
q−cnt1,q, where cnt0,q is the number of occurrences of 0 in q, and cnt1,q is the number of occurrences of 1 in q. 
The number of such prefixes can be infinite; if it is so, you must say that.
A prefix is a string consisting of several first letters of a given string, without any reorders. 
An empty prefix is also a valid prefix.
For example, the string "abcd" has 5 prefixes: empty string, "a", "ab", "abc" and "abcd".

Input
The first line contains the single integer T (1≤T≤100) — the number of test cases.
Next 2T lines contain descriptions of test cases — two lines per test case. 
The first line contains two integers n and x (1≤n≤105, −109≤x≤109) 
— the length of string s and the desired balance, respectively.
The second line contains the binary string s (|s|=n, si∈{0,1}).
It's guaranteed that the total sum of n doesn't exceed 105.
